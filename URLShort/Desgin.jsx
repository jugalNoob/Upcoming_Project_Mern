✅ Yes — a URL Shortener with proper System Design is an excellent project
 for job interviews, especially for backend or full-stack developer roles.
It shows that you understand scalability, databases, caching, load balancing, 
and API design, not just writing code.

Here’s why it’s a great choice 👇

🧠 Key Skills It Demonstrates


 

| Skill                   | How the Project Shows It                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Development** | You’ll build REST APIs for shortening and redirecting URLs.                                     |
| **System Design**       | You’ll handle large-scale URL generation, unique ID encoding, and distributed systems concepts. |
| **Database Modeling**   | Choosing between SQL vs NoSQL for storing URLs, handling unique constraints.                    |
| **Caching**             | Using Redis to speed up redirections.                                                           |
| **Scalability**         | Designing for millions of URL hits per day.                                                     |
| **Security**            | Rate limiting, preventing abuse, validating URLs.                                               |
| **Testing & CI/CD**     | Adding unit/integration tests and automating deployment makes it production-like.               |




🏗️ Basic System Design for URL Shortener


[ Client ]
   |
   v
[ Load Balancer ]
   |
   v
[ Application Servers (Node.js / Express) ]
   |
   +--> [ Cache (Redis) ]
   |
   v
[ Database (e.g., MongoDB / PostgreSQL) ]




Shorten API: POST /shorten → stores original URL + generated short code.

Redirect API: GET /{shortCode} → looks up original URL and redirects.

⚡ Key Design Considerations

1::Unique ID Generation

Incremental IDs encoded in base62 (0–9, A–Z, a–z)

Or use hash functions like MD5/SHA256 (with collision checks)

2::Caching Layer

..Redis can cache popular short links to reduce DB hits.

3::High Availability

..Load balancers, horizontal scaling of stateless servers.

3::Database Choice

..SQL for strict uniqueness and easy indexing.

NoSQL for horizontal scaling and speed (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).

4::Analytics (optional)

Track number of hits per link, timestamp, IP (good for bonus points).

5::Expiration Policy (optional)

Allow temporary URLs with TTL.


🧱 Features You Can Add to Impress Recruiters

✅ Custom alias for URLs (e.g., /myproduct)

✅ Dashboard to view click stats

✅ Authentication & rate limiting

✅ QR code generation

✅ Deployment on cloud (AWS / Render / Vercel)
