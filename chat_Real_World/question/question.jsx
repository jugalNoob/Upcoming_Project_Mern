The architecture you‚Äôve described‚ÄîMERN stack + Kafka + Redis + Socket.IO, with event-driven communication and real-time updates‚Äîfits into a few architectural patterns:

1. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

Core idea: Components communicate by producing and consuming events rather than direct requests.

Your case:

Kafka acts as the event bus.

Producers send events (e.g., new chat message, login event).

Consumers process events asynchronously (store in DB, send notifications).

2. Microservices Architecture (loosely coupled)

Each service (like user authentication, chat service, analytics) can run independently and scale separately.

Kafka decouples communication between services.

Redis can be used for caching or pub/sub for quick data propagation.

3. Reactive / Real-Time Architecture

Uses Socket.IO for real-time communication to the client.

Supports instant updates (chat messages, live price tracking, metrics dashboard).

Combines with Redis and Kafka for high throughput and low latency.

So, a concise name:

‚ÄúEvent-Driven Microservices with Real-Time Capabilities‚Äù
or simply
‚ÄúReal-Time Event-Driven MERN Architecture‚Äù
